    <h2>Raven - Kelela</h2>

    <audio src="media/kelela_contact.m4a" controls></audio>
    <p>Now Playing: Contact</p>
    <p>Kelela is by far one of my favorite artists of all time. Raven truly resonated with me with its heavy themes and dance and ambient music.</p>
      
    <h2>Heaven knows - PinkPantheress</h2>

    <audio src="media/pinkpantheress_true_romance.m4a" controls></audio>
    <p>Now Playing: True Romance</p>
    <p>I fell in love with her first album "to hell with it" so I was very excited to hear her new releases. It's easy to say that I enjoyed this album a lot, I just wish her songs were a bit longer.</p>

    <h2>Regulate The First Album Repackage - NCT 127</h2>
    <img src="media/regulate.jpg" alt="Cover art for Regulate by NCT 127">
    <audio src="media/knock_on.m4a" controls></audio>
    <p>Now Playing: Knock On</p>
    <p>I've been a fan of this group for many years, as I've seen them in concert twice! I was obsessed with this repackage when it released and I still am to this day.</p>

    <h2>Swimmer - Tennis</h2>
    <img src="media/swimmer.jpg" alt="Cover art for Swimmer by Tennis">
    <audio src="media/tennis_runner.m4a" controls></audio>
    <p>Now Playing: Runner</p>
    <p>Honestly, I love all of Tennis' music and this album just stands out to me so much. Shoutout to my favorite tracks "Runner" and "Need Your Love".</p>

    <h2>Gaussian - Youra</h2>
    <img src="media/gaussian.jpg" alt="Cover art for Gaussian by Youra">

    <p>Now Playing: Airplane Mode</p>
    <p>Such a nice and diverse album with some chill tunes and some upbeat tracks as well. Really an amazing artist.</p>
