    <h1>My Current Top 5 Favorite Albums</h1>
    <p>Here are some of my favorite albums currently, and my favorite track from it.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Raven - Kelela</li>
      <img src="media/raven.jpg" alt="Cover art for Raven by Kelela" width="150" height="150">
      <audio src="media/Kelela - Contact.m4a" controls></audio>
      <p>Now Playing: Contact</p>
      <p>Kelela is by far one of my favorite artists of all time. Raven truly resonated with me with its heavy themes and dance and ambient music.</p>
      
      <li>Heaven knows - PinkPantheress</li>
      <img src="media/heaven knows.jpg" alt="Cover art for Heaven knows by PinkPantheress" width="150" height="150">
      <audio src="media/PinkPantheress - True romance.m4a" controls></audio>
      <p>Now Playing: True Romance</p>
      <p>I fell in love with her first album "to hell with it" so I was very excited to hear her new releases. It's easy to say that I enjoyed this albbum a lot, I just wish her songs were a bit longer.</p>

      <li>Regulate The First Album Repackage - NCT 127</li>
      <img src="media/regulate.jpg" alt="Cover art for Regulate by NCT 127" width="150" height="150">
      <audio src="media/Knock On.m4a" controls></audio>
      <p>Now Playing: Knock On</p>
      <p>I've been a fan of this group for many years, as I've seen them in concert twice! I was obsessed with this repackage when it released and I still am to this day.</p>

      <li>Swimmer - Tennis</li>
      <img src="media/swimmer.jpg" alt="Cover art for Swimmer by Tennis" width="150" height="150">
      <audio src="media/Tennis - Runner.m4a" controls></audio>
      <p>Now Playing: Runner</p>
      <p>Honestly, I love all of Tennis' music and this album just stands out to me so much. Shoutout to my favorite tracks "Runner" and "Need Your Love".</p>

      <li>Gaussian - Youra</li>
      <img src="media/gaussian.jpg" alt="Cover art for Gaussian by Youra" width="150" height="150">
      <audio src="media/airplane mode.m4a" controls></audio>
      <p>Now Playing: Airplane Mode</p>
      <p>Such a nice and diverse album with some chill tunes and some upbeat tracks as well. Really an amazing artist.</p>
