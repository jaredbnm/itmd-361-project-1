    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>One hobby I really enjoy is video editing. I basically make edits of whatever I am interested in and share them on the internet. Below is an edit I recently made for my friend's birthday!</p>

    <p>Another hobby I enjoy is fashion. I love browsing clothes and creating outfits with pieces I see. I also really enjoy watching fashion shows and observing creative pieces from fashion designers. Here are some looks from the Prada menswear show.</p>
