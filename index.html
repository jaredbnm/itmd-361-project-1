        <p>Hello, my name is Jared Benman and I am a second year at Illinois Tech! I am currently an ITM major and I plan to use my degree to become a UI/UX designer in the future.</p>
        <p>I'm from Michigan, and I was born in Detroit.</p>

        <h2 id="header2">Hobbies</h2>
        <p>One hobby I really enjoy is video/picture editing on Adobe After Effects. I basically make edits of whatever I am interested in and share them on the internet. Below is an edit I recently made for my friend's birthday!</p>

        <p>Another hobby I enjoy is fashion. I love browsing clothes and creating outfits with pieces I see. I also really enjoy watching fashion shows and observing creative pieces from fashion designers. Here are some looks from the Prada menswear show.</p>
